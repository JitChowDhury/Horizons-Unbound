A minimal **2D side-scroller prototype** built with **C++ & SFML**.  
The focus is on learning **procedural world generation**, **chunk-based systems**, and **camera/parallax techniques** while keeping the project scope small.

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 **Procedurally generated terrain** using noise-based heightmaps
- 🎮 **Player movement** with gravity, jumping, and collision
- 📷 **Dynamic camera** following the player across an endless world
- 🌌 **Parallax backgrounds** (multi-layered for depth)
- 🧩 **Chunk-based system** for infinite world expansion
